I think main feature should be QBS network, of course it needs deep thinking and testing, but if you can bring qbs network to people - i think they will like it.
QBS mathematically can by proved anonymous.

Main reasons for users:
- Fast speed, like 10 gigabits
- All apps (simple)
- kill switch (may be banned in Russia)
- Free trial
- Allow paying in crypto
- unlimited devices, but limited keys
- limited countries (only high speeds)
- simplier = coolier

About servers:
- aeza.net (Shared)
- simple scaling (if there a lot of users)

About dev features:
- docker containers
- monitoring (not only about servers, but about all networks and speeds)
- QBS???
- auto reconnect to fastets
